CancelMultiQuery: Cancel / Clear a previously started query-set

Cancel the query-set (if still running) / clear the data (if already returned) The following error codes are to be anticipated with standard Problem Detail reports: - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden - 404 Not Found : The requested query result doesn't exist and is not running.

# **get_progress_of_multi_query**
> BackgroundMultiQueryProgressResponse get_progress_of_multi_query(execution_id)

GetProgressOfMultiQuery: View progress of the entire query-set load

View progress information (up until this point) for the entire query-set The following error codes are to be anticipated with standard Problem Detail reports: - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden - 404 Not Found : The requested query result doesn't exist and is not running. - 429 Too Many Requests : Please try your request again soon   1. The query has been executed successfully in the past yet the server-instance receiving this request (e.g. from a load balancer) doesn't yet have this data available.   1. By virtue of the request you have just placed this will have started to load from the persisted cache and will soon be available.   1. It is also the case that the original server-instance to process the original query is likely to already be able to service this request.

StartQueries: Run a given set of Sql queries in the background

 Allow for starting a potentially long running query and getting back an immediate response with how to  - fetch the data in various formats (if available, or if not simply being informed it is not yet ready), on a per result basis - view progress information (up until this point), for all results in one go - cancel the queries (if still running) / clear the data (if already returned)  The following error codes are to be anticipated with standard Problem Detail reports: - 400 BadRequest - there was something wrong with your query syntax (the issue was detected at parse-time) - 401 Unauthorized - 403 Forbidden
